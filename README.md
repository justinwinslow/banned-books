# What is this?

With all the recent book banning in the US I realized there wasn't an easily searchable index of all the various bans. So, I set out to create this to improve the transparency around our current censorious moment.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve searching to allow looser, weighted matches  
- [ ] Filter on topics/keywords  
- [ ] The current data source is static, this could maybe be dynamic or crowd-sourced  
- [ ] ?  


## Running the app

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
